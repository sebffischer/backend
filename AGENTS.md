## Glossary

* We use Arrays not Tensors
* An array has axes, not dimensions.
* The number of axes are num_axes.
* An axis has a length, not a size, not a dimension.
* An array has a data type, often abbreviated dtype.
* We use ArrayType to represent the dtype and all axes.
* Axes is used instead of Shape.
* An implementation of the abstract backend is called a “concrete backend”.
